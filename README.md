# Rust Interpreter for Monkey Language

This project is a Rust implementation of an interpreter for the Monkey programming language, following the concepts and principles described in the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) + [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/). The Monkey language is a simple, educational programming language designed to demonstrate the process of building an interpreter from scratch.


## Getting Started

cd my-monkey-lang
```

3. Build the project:
